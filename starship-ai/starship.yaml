  # host, port, and log_level define what the container should listen on and to what detail

  # the value you set port to here.  For running inside of a container, host should remain
  # 0.0.0.0 - for running locally (e.g., by installing the package and running via the CLI),
  # you can change host to 127.0.0.1 or any other IP address your system will allow you to listen
  # on.

# Each endpoint describes how to talk to a specific endpoint of a specific type.
#     The name is simply a user-friendly string.
#     The url used to build the specific path to this endpoint.
#     The type simply defines what type of thing we're talking to.  Valid values are NBBE, NEF,
#         and NPC
#     The connect_ and read_ timeouts are used when calling the relevant URL - connect controls
#         how long we should wait for the API call to connect and read controls how long we
#         should wait for the URL to respond to our request.
#     The headers contain the list of headers that are required for this endpoint.  As a rule,
#         we expect to have both Accept and Content-Type provided.  Only application/json is
#         currently supported for both.  Any other headers provided will be sent as-is.
